# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Nanodegree Project 2: Continuous Control
This repository contains implementation of Continuous Control project as a part of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.

In this project a double-jointed arm is trained to control its position for a moving target.

A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.
